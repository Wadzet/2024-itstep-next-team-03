            "Proper jewelry care is essential to keep your pieces looking beautiful and lasting longer. Always remove jewelry before sleeping, exercising, swimming, or doing household chores to prevent scratches, damage, or exposure to harsh chemicals. Perfumes, lotions, and sprays can tarnish metals or dull gemstones, so it’s best to put on jewelry after getting ready. Keeping jewelry dry is also important, as moisture can accelerate tarnishing, especially for silver and costume pieces—storing them with silica gel packs can help. Regular gentle cleaning with a soft brush and mild soapy water works well for most metals, but delicate stones like pearls should only be wiped with a damp cloth. To avoid scratches and tangles, store each piece separately in soft pouches or a jewelry box with compartments. With these simple practices, your jewelry will stay in great condition for years to come.",
